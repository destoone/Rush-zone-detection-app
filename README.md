# Rush-zone-detection-app
The rush zone detection application is an application that gives you the possibility to see how the odds trend varies in order to determine where the rushes are in sports betting. Then trains models to predict the odds. 

### App structure
`Used dependencies & technologies:` We have an application entirely coded in python, so we will need to install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) as well as some libraries like [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/). We will use the Dash framework, which you can find [here](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-enterprise), or a [tutorial](https://dash.plotly.com/installation) that allows you to take the basics of the framework. So Dash is a python framework dedicated to the developers of machine learning applications. Dash uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) behind it which will allow us to use the necessary web components for our web application. 
So we will make a separate treatment, a treatment that will allow us to make our analysis, our visualizations and our predictions. To do this we will use [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and a notebook as editor.

### Presentation 
`The goal:` Here the goal is to determine the rush zones, what we call by rush is what represents the highest odds for each game. We will use a database of Premier League between 2010 and 2018. So we will start by presenting the Premier League, the different teams.
